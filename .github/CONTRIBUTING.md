* [Submitting a pull request](#submitting-a-pull-request)

## Suggesting a feature

We can't think of everything. If you've got a good idea for a feature, then please let us know!

Feature suggestions are embraced, but will often be filed for a rainy day. If you require a feature urgently it's best to write it yourself. Don't forget to share ;)

## Filing a bug report

If you run into a problem with one of our libraries or examples then please let us know. Be as detailed as possible, and be ready to answer questions when we get back to you.

## Submitting a pull request

If you've decided to fix a bug, work on a feature, or contribute an example it's best to let us know what you're working on first.

When contributing a new example or making a change to a library please keep your code style consistent with ours. We try to stick to the pep8 guidelines for Python (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

#### Do

* Do use pep8 style guidelines
* Do comment your code where necessary
* Do include a description of what your example is expected to do
* Do add details of your example to examples/README.md if it exists

#### Don't

* Don't include any license information in your examples- our repositories are MIT licensed
* Don't credit yourself as the author in examples- you will appear on the contributors page
* Don't try to do too much at once- submit one or two examples at a time, and be receptive to feedback

### If you're submitting an example...

Try to do one thing, an do it concisely. Keep it simple. Don't mix too many ideas.

The ideal example should:

* demonstrate one idea, technique or API as concisely as possible.
* *just work* when you run it. Although sometimes configuration is necessary.
* be well commented and attempt to teach the user how and why it works.
* document any configuration that needs to be added, and how to find API keys, etc.

### Licensing

When you submit code to our libraries, you implicitly agree to adopt the library license. This is usually the MIT license, which permits Commercial Use, Modification, Distribution and Private use of our code, and therefore also your contributions. You can learn more about the MIT license at Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License

### Subitting your code

Once you're ready to share your contribution with us you should submit it as a Pull Request.

* Be ready to receive and embrace constructive feedback.
* Be prepared for rejection; we can't always accept contributions. If you're unsure, ask first!
