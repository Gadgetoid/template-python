## Help us to help you!

Thank you for taking the time to contribute!

* [Filing a bug report](#filing-a-bug-report)
* [Submitting a pull request](#submitting-a-pull-request)

## Suggesting a feature

We can't think of everything. If you've got a good idea for a feature, then please let us know!

Feature suggestions are embraced, but will often be filed for a rainy day. If you require a feature urgently it's best to write it yourself. Don't forget to share ;)

When suggesting a feature, make sure to:

* Check the code on GitHub to make sure it's not already hiding in an unreleased version ;)
* Considered if it's necessary in the library, or is an advanced technique that could be separately explained in an example
* Check existing issues, open and closed, to make sure it hasn't already been suggested

## Filing a bug report

If you run into a problem with one of our libraries or examples then please let us know. Be as detailed as possible, and be ready to answer questions when we get back to you.

Please include details such as:

* Your model of Raspberry Pi
* The OS you're using (`lsb_release -d` and `uname -a`)
* The steps you've taken so far
* Any solutions you've tried
* A paste/picture of the complete error output from the failing script or library

We have a diagnostic script: `curl get.pimoroni.com/diagnostic | bash` to help you gather information.

## Submitting a pull request

If you've decided to fix a bug, work on a feature, or contribute an example it's best to let us know what you're working on first.

When contributing a new example or making a change to a library please keep your code style consistent with ours. We try to stick to the pep8 guidelines for Python (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

#### Do

* Do use pep8 style guidelines
* Do comment your code where necessary
* Do include a description of what your example is expected to do
* Do add details of your example to examples/README.md if it exists

#### Don't

* Don't include any license information in your examples- our repositories are MIT licensed
* Don't credit yourself as the author in examples- you will automatically appear on the GitHub contributors page
* Don't try to do too much at once- submit one or two examples at a time, and be receptive to feedback

### If you're submitting an example

Try to do one thing, an do it concisely. Keep it simple. Don't mix too many ideas.

The ideal example should:

* demonstrate one idea, technique or API as concisely as possible
* *just work* when you run it. Although sometimes configuration is necessary
* be well commented and attempt to teach the user how and why it works
* document any required configuration, and how to install API keys, dependencies, etc

### Licensing

When you submit code to our libraries, you implicitly and irrevocably agree to adopt the associated license. You should be able to find this in the file named `LICENSE`.

We typically use the MIT license; which permits Commercial Use, Modification, Distribution and Private use of our code, and therefore also your contributions. It also provides good compatibility with other licenses, and is intended to make re-use of our code as painless as possible for all parties.

You can learn more about the MIT license at Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License

### Subitting your code

Once you're ready to share your contribution with us you should submit it as a Pull Request.

* Be ready to receive and embrace constructive feedback.
* Be prepared for rejection; we can't always accept contributions. If you're unsure, ask first!

## Thank you!

If you have any questions, concerns or comments about these guidelines, please get in touch. You can do this by raising an issue against our template repository here: https://github.com/pimoroni/template-python

Above all else, we hope you enjoy yourself, learn things and make and share great contributions.

Happy hacking!
